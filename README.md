# Dare Your Body - Diagnosis Listings

### What is it?
It is a React application that allows users to create new patient records, type their data and diagnosis, edit these diagnosis or delete them entirely.

### Installation && Launching
In the terminal type:
- yarn install 
- yarn run build
- yarn run dev-server
Then:
- Open the link localhost:8080 in any browser.

### Why I wrote it this way?
I wanted to lessen the amount of 3rd parties used as possible so I did not use redux to manage the state though it would have been much easier to do so. I managed the state entirely through the App component and passed it when necessary to descendant components.

### What did I do?
- I created an App component that is responsible for managing the state for the entire application. This is the list of patients saved.
- I created a Patient component that renders the data of each patient separately.
- I rendered the EditDiagnosis component within the Patient Component, allowwed it to pull the data from the Patient component (name, phone, diagnosis) and dump them into a form.
- The editing form reads data from the Patient component props. Added onChange property on the edit form inputs to make changing them possible.
- I preferred to use a textarea element for the diagnosis to allow for extensive writing instead of input.

### Technologies Used:
- React
- Bootstrap (As recommended)
- CSS Preprocessor (SASS)
- Webpack
- Babel (to transpile the JSX)
